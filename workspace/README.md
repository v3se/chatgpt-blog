Given the requirements, we will be using Python with Flask for the backend, HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, and Google OAuth for authentication. We will also use SQLAlchemy for database operations and Bootstrap for responsive design.

Here are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary:

1. `app.py`: This is the entry point of our application. It will contain the Flask application instance and the routes for our website.

2. `models.py`: This file will contain the SQLAlchemy models for our database. We will have a `User` model for the users of our website and a `Post` model for the blog posts.

3. `forms.py`: This file will contain the Flask-WTF forms for our website. We will have a `LoginForm` for the login page and a `PostForm` for creating and editing blog posts.

4. `auth.py`: This file will contain the functions for handling Google OAuth.

5. `templates/`: This directory will contain the HTML templates for our website.

6. `static/`: This directory will contain the static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) for our website.

7. `requirements.txt`: This file will list all the Python dependencies for our project.

Let's start with the `app.py` file:
